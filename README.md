# Handmade Dodge Game
This is a project inspired by the Handmade Hero series by Casey Muratori, written for macos using Metal.

This was written on an older mac running Ventura and uses some soon-to-be deprecated api calls, but so far has worked on newer versions of macos too. Cargo run to launch, ctrl-c in terminal to kill the process (close button / quit behavior not implemented yet)
